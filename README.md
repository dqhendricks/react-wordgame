# react-wordgame
I created this word game from the ground up using react, tailwind, and framer-motion.

This was my first attempt at using framer-motion for animations, which was a ton of fun. Using Framer Motion and Tailwind together made UI development an incredibly fast process. I started with what data I thought I would need to load a game stage, which I originally put into a JSON file, but eventually moved to TS so I could easily type it. I then started to build a reducer to load the initial game state, and from there, the components and actions.

Give the game a try now by [clicking here](https://dustinhendricks.com/wordgame).

Cheers!
